# Style
- Read [Google's C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
- Run [cpplint](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cpplint/)
```bash
$ cpplint src/path/to/my/code.cpp
```
- Run [clang-format](http://llvm.org/releases/3.8.0/tools/clang/docs/ClangFormat.html) with ```-style=file``` using provided [.clang-format](https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/blob/master/.clang-format)
```bash
$ cd kovri/ && clang-format -style=file src/path/to/my/code.cpp
```

## Here's what's currently not caught by clang-format and differs from Google's proposed C++ style

- Keep with codebase's present (vertical) style for consistency
- Implementation file extension is ``cpp`` instead of ``cc``.
- Newline break all function parameters for consisentcy across codebase
- When function args newline break, ensure that *every* arg indent is 4 spaces

```cpp
  /// @brief Constructs SSU header with pre-determined payload type
  explicit SSUHeader(
      SSUPayloadType type);

  /// @brief Constructs SSU header with pre-determined payload type and content
  /// @note Assumes content is valid
  /// @param SSUPayloadType SSU payload type
  /// @param mac Pointer to header's MAC material
  /// @param iv Pointer to header's IV material
  /// @param time Header's timestamp
  SSUHeader(
      SSUPayloadType type,
      std::uint8_t* mac,
      std::uint8_t* iv,
      std::uint32_t time);

  /// @brief Sets MAC from appointed position within header
  /// @note Assumes content is valid (based on position)
  void SetMAC(
      std::uint8_t* mac);

  /// @brief Gets acquired MAC after it has been set when parsed
  /// @return Pointer to MAC material
  std::uint8_t* GetMAC() const;
```

- Expressions can be broken before operators if:
  - The line is greater that 80 columns
  - Doing so aids in better documentation

```cpp
if (this is a very long expr1
    && this is a very long expr2
    && this is also a very long expr3)
  DoSomeThing();
```

```cpp
return SSUPacket::GetSize()
       + static_cast<std::size_t>(SSUSize::DHPublic)  // Y to complete the DH agreement
       + 1 + m_AddressSize  // 1 byte address size, address size,
       + 2 + 4 + 4          // Port size (2 bytes), relay tag size, time size
       + m_SignatureSize;   // Signature size
```

- Class member variables should be prepended with ```m_```
- Don't use "cheap function" names; always use MixedCaseFunctions()
- Avoid prepended mixed-case ```k``` and MACRO_TYPE for all constants
- Use Doxygen three-slash ```/// C++ comments``` when documenting for Doxygen
- Document all your work for Doxygen as you progress
- New files should maintain consistency with other filename style
- If anonymity is a concern, try to blend in with a present contributor's style
